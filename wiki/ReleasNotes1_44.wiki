= Changes =

== Skip redundant redeploy by md5 ==

  * server redist directory now has state subdirectory, containing ".ver" files, holding information about redist path of deployed item and its md5sum data
  * every ordinary redist operation skips deployment items which produce the same ".ver" content (i.e. deploy path, file name, version and md5sum)
  * ./redist.sh -ignoreversion will ignore file version in redundancy check
  * ./redist.sh -force turns off redundancy check at all

== Implement custom deploy scripts for hotdeploy ==
