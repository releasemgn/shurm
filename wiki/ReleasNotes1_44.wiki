|| 4 || Add predefined release labels - last, next || no ||

= Common Changes =

== Introduce top-level scripts ==

  * master directory now contains top-level scripts to be used for execute different UMR functions - build, deployment etc
  * release.sh script added - to build, get configuration and DB changes and deploy all into uat environment using one command
{{{
./release.sh default uat - next planned release
./release.sh 1.13.5-demo uat - given release
}}}

= Deployment Changes =

== Implement custom deploy scripts for hotdeploy ==

  * new server-level property "hotdeploydata" - holds any additional parameters passed to server.upload.sh hotdeploy script
  * new server-level property "deployscript" - can be used to change  hotdeploy script name from server.upload.sh to user-defined
  * server-level property "hotdeployserver" - new predefined value "local" to use local host as a server for hotdeploy
   * redist directory should exist on local server
   * upload script should be in $PRODUCT_DEPLOYMENT_HOME/custom script folder of URM installation

== Skip redundant redeploy by md5 ==

  * server redist directory now has state subdirectory, containing ".ver" files, holding information about redist path of deployed item and its md5sum data
  * every ordinary redist operation skips deployment items which produce the same ".ver" content (i.e. deploy path, file name, version and md5sum)
  * ./redist.sh -ignoreversion will ignore file version in redundancy check
  * ./redist.sh -force turns off redundancy check at all

== Add predefined release labels - last, next ==

  * new predefined release label "last" - points to $C_CONFIG_VERSION_LAST_FULL value defined in product config.sh script
  * new predefined release label "next" - points to $C_CONFIG_VERSION_NEXT_FULL value defined in product config.sh script

= Bugfixes =

  * *codebase-setversion.sh* is fixed: available for both git and svn
  * *sqlapply.sh* is fixed: now 10-minute limitation affects only single script, not full patch set; also 30-second connectivity test limitation affects only one scheme, not all schemes
