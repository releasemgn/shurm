#summary Build and manage distributions
[home] -> [documentation] -> [makedistr]
----

Defines how to produce distributives from codebase, thirdparty items, required specific updates in settings and database.

  * [deployment]

== Definitions ==

  * *VCS*: Version Control System, supported - svn, git
  * *Codebase Repository*: VCS location which corresponds to URM rules
  * *Work Copy*: local copy of repository source code or copy of repository indended to review or source code modifications
  * *Branch*: VCS location where repository codebase is consistent and store specific set of changes
  * *Tag*: VCS element allowing to assign name to specific state in specific branch history

== Overview ==

  * makedist module implements URM baseline release policy of builds  
  * makedist module is accessed in $MYP_DEPLOYMENT_HOME/master/makedistr
  * makedist module supports svn and giv VCS
  * makedist module depends on:
   * primary product parameters in config.sh
   * repository and build items in source.xml
   * definition of distributive in distr.xml

== Version Control System Support ==

Scripts to make common VCS operations using the same interface disregarding VCS type:

|| *Script* ||*Function* || *svn* || *git* ||
|| vcscheckout.sh || create codebase work copy to modify || yes || yes ||
|| vcscommit.sh || send modifications to team repository || yes || yes ||
|| vcscopybranch.sh || create branch in team repository || yes || yes ||
|| vcscopynewtag.sh || create new tag in team repository || yes || yes ||
|| vcscopytag.sh || create/replace tag in team repository || yes || yes ||
|| vcsdiff.sh || get changes between tags in team repository || yes || no ||
|| vcsdroptag.sh || drop tag in team repository || yes || yes ||
|| vcsexport.sh || create read-only codebase workcopy || yes || yes ||
|| vcsrenamebranch.sh || rename branch in codebase workcopy || yes || yes ||
|| vcsrenametag.sh || rename tag in codebase workcopy || yes || yes ||
|| vcssettag.sh || set tag to branch head in codebase workcopy || yes || yes ||

== git Support Details ==

  * repository name - $PROJECTNAME.git
  * only one codebase repository can be stored in one VCS repository
  * build can be done only from:
   * head of branch named: branch-xxx (refs/heads/branch-xxx, xxx - the same as for svn)
   * tag named: tag-xxx (refs/tags/tag-xxx, xxx - the same as for svn)
  * mirror repositories:
   * git requires using copy of local repository - mirror repository, not work copy only
   * set of mirror repositories is located in $C_CONFIG_GITMIRRORPATH, defined in primary product parameter file
   * to create mirror copy, execute below script:
{{{
F_GIT_SOURCE=gitolite@YOUR_GIT_HOSTING:$PROJECTNAME.git
F_GIT_MIRROR=$C_CONFIG_GITMIRRORPATH/$PROJECTNAME.git

rm -rf $F_GIT_MIRROR
git clone --mirror $F_GIT_SOURCE $F_GIT_MIRROR
}}}
  * each operation is performed with first getting changes from master (team) VCS repository and finally pushing changes to master VCS repository
  * build user is release-mgn, should have access to read repository and to create tags
