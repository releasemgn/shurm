Defines how to apply distributives to environments in consistent manner.

= Definitions =

  * *system* - one or more products working together to provide solution in certain business area
  * *environment* - set of hosts, databases and processes which implement part of product functionality
  * *server* - process type in given environment, defines set of application items running in process of given server
  * *server node* - specific instance of server implementing server functionality
  * *server node process* - operating system process running in context of given server node
  * *server cluster* - set of server nodes implementing server functionality aimed to increase reliability or total throughput of the system

= Overview =

  * *deployment* module supports binary and configuration deployment, see [database Database] for database modification details
  * *deployment* module performs template processing when rolling out configuration files, see [configurationguidelines Configuration Guidelines] for template processing details
  * *deployment* module supports cold and hold deployments
   * cold deployment consists of rolling out binaries and configuration files while server is stopped and loading new versions on startup
   * cold deployment in clustered configuration can be performed without loss of service
   * hot deployment can be supported by application server software allowing redeploying applications without stopping application server
