  * product generally consists of buildable codebase, prebuild binaries, configuration files, database metadata and non-operational data
  * configuration files and database can be treated as special types of codebase
  * buildable codebase is defined in source.xml as a set of projects of "core" category:
{{{
<source>
  <project name="pgu-portal" vcs="svn" version="branch" jira="PGUDEV">
    <distitem name="gu-web" type="staticwar" path="com/nvision/pgu/portal"/>
    <distitem name="pgu-dependencies" type="nexus" extension="-libs.tar.gz" path="com/nvision/pgu/portal"/>
  </project>
  <project name="sp" vcs="git" version="branch" group="core" path="fedpgu" jira="PGUDEV"/>
