Explains how to maintain product codebase using URM.

----

= Define product codebase =

  * product generally consists of buildable codebase, prebuild binaries, configuration files, database metadata and non-operational data
  * configuration files and database can be treated as special types of codebase
  * buildable codebase is defined in source.xml as a set of projects of "core" category
  * prebuilt binaries are defined in source.xml grouped in projects of "prebuilt" category
  * configuration items are defined in distr.xml
  * database part of product is defined by production instance, concept of URM takes into account that it practically impossible to track database using DDL scripts; more specifically, URM approach is to make use of continious reverse engineering - with regular PROD snapshots, generating metadata and dumping product data

= Define product buildable codebase =

  * before build you need to declare buildable codebase in source.xml as a set of projects
{{{
<source>
<projectset type="core">
  <project name="pgu-portal" vcs="svn" version="branch" jira="PGUDEV">
    <distitem name="gu-web" type="staticwar" path="com/nvision/pgu/portal"/>
    <distitem name="pgu-dependencies" type="nexus" extension="-libs.tar.gz" path="com/nvision/pgu/portal"/>
  </project>
  <project name="sp" vcs="git" version="branch" path="fedpgu" jira="PGUDEV"/>

- in URM each project is built as a whole, so you need to plan your codebase structure
- every project has its own set of tags and branches containing whole project scope
- "name" defines reference name and VCS name as well
- "vcs" can be git or svn or svnnew
svn/svnnew allow repository migration
- "version" can be "branch" or "trunk"
branch means prod status
trunk means non-production codebase - full release build will skip building this project
- "path" - in git repository means group, in svn repository means parent path
- "branch" defines default production branch
- "javaversion" - defines jdk version to use to build this project
- "mavenversion" - defines maven version to use to build this project
