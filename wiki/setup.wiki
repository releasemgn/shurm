= Create Your Product URM =

  * prerequisites (see framework diagram at https://code.google.com/p/shurm)
{{{
Allocate at least one Linux box for release activities.
It is better to create separate hosts for:
- Release Build Machine (build box)
- UAT/Test Administration Host (deploy box)
- Release Storage (distribution box)
Still you can have the only host for all purposes (release box).
Also you can move environment monitoring from deploy box to separate host (monitoring box).
You can have several build boxes, several deploy boxes and several monitoring boxes.
}}}
  * framework setup
{{{
Accounts and access:
- create release-mgn account on build, deploy and distribution boxes
- create release-mon account on monitoring box
- create release-reaser account on distribution box
- provide access to svn or git source code to build box
- provide access to UAT/Test hosts to deploy box
- provide access to distribution box to build and deploy boxes

Ensure build can be performed on build box:
- check maven and nexus are available to build box
- check proper jdk versions are installed
- install xmlstarlet 1.2.1 (or later) package
- install svn repository to store Your Product URM and database/configuration release items

Ensure environment management can be performed on deployment box:
- create release-mgn/release-mon ssh keypair and place public key to UAT/Test hosts
- install xmlstarlet 1.2.1 (or later) package
}}}
  * create Your Product URM module (see also [releases])
{{{
1. select Your Product URM home, e.g. /release-mgn/urm/myp
- set shell variable (add to profile) MYP_DEPLOYMENT_HOME to URM home (e.g. /release-mgn/urm/myp)
- do it first on one build box
2. create directory structure
	/release-mgn/urm/myp
	/release-mgn/urm/myp/etc
	/release-mgn/urm/myp/etc/env
	/release-mgn/urm/myp/master
3. download latest release, untar release archive to temporary directory, which will be populated by:
- upgrade.sh script
- master directory
4. cd to temporary directory and execute initial install using
	./upgrade.sh /release-mgn/urm/myp
5. copy master/samples/etc/config.sh to /release-mgn/urm/myp/etc
- change product identification properties in config.sh 
6. add Your Product URM to your svn repository
	svn import /release-mgn/urm/myp <my-svn-store-path>
7. distribute  Your Product URM to all build, deploy and monitoring boxes
- svn co <my-svn-store-path> /release-mgn/urm/myp
- /release-mgn/urm/myp/master/svnget.sh /release-mgn/urm/myp
