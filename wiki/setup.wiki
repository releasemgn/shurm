= Create Your Product URM =

  * prerequisites (see framework diagram at https://code.google.com/p/shurm)
{{{
Allocate at least one linux box for release activities.
It is better to create separate hosts for Release Build Machine (build box), UAT/Test Administration Host (deploy box) and Release Storage (distribution box), but you can have the only host for all purposes (release box)
}}}
  * framework setup
{{{
Accounts and access:
- create release-mgn, release-reader, release-mon accounts
- provide access to svn or git source code to build box
- provide access to UAT hosts to deploy box
- provide access to distribution box to build and deploy boxes

Ensure build can be performed on build box:
- check maven and nexus are available to build box
- check project jdk versions are installed
- install xmlstarlet 1.2.1 (or later) package

Ensure environment management can be performed on deployment box:
- check UAT hosts are available by ssh from release-mgn and release-mon accounts
- install xmlstarlet 1.2.1 (or later) package
}}}
  * create Product URM module (see also [releases])
{{{
1. select Product URM home, e.g. /release-mgn/urm/myp
- set shell variable (add to profile) MYP_DEPLOYMENT_HOME to URM home (e.g. /release-mgn/urm/myp)
2. create directory structure
	/release-mgn/urm/myp
	/release-mgn/urm/myp/etc
	/release-mgn/urm/myp/etc/env
	/release-mgn/urm/myp/master
3. download latest release, untar release archive to temporary directory, which will be populated by:
- upgrade.sh script
- master directory
4. cd to temporary directory and execute initial install using
	./upgrade.sh /release-mgn/urm/myp
5. copy master/samples/etc/config.sh to /release-mgn/urm/myp/etc
- change product identification properties config.sh
