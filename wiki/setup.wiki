= Create Your Product URM =

  * prerequisites (see framework diagram at https://code.google.com/p/shurm)
{{{
Allocate at least one Linux box for release activities.
It is better to create separate hosts for:
- Release Build Machine (build box)
- UAT/Test Administration Host (deploy box)
- Release Storage (distribution box)
Still you can have the only host for all purposes (release box).
Also you can move environment monitoring from deploy box to separate host (monitoring box)
}}}
  * framework setup
{{{
Accounts and access:
- create release-mgn account on build, deploy and distribution boxes
- create release-mon account on monitoring box
- create release-reaser account on distribution box
- provide access to svn or git source code to build box
- provide access to UAT/Test hosts to deploy box
- provide access to distribution box to build and deploy boxes

Ensure build can be performed on build box:
- check maven and nexus are available to build box
- check proper jdk versions are installed
- install xmlstarlet 1.2.1 (or later) package

Ensure environment management can be performed on deployment box:
- create release-mgn/release-mon ssh keypair and place public key to UAT/Test hosts
- install xmlstarlet 1.2.1 (or later) package
}}}
  * create Your Product URM module (see also [releases])
{{{
1. select Your Product URM home, e.g. /release-mgn/urm/myp
- set shell variable (add to profile) MYP_DEPLOYMENT_HOME to URM home (e.g. /release-mgn/urm/myp)
2. create directory structure
	/release-mgn/urm/myp
	/release-mgn/urm/myp/etc
	/release-mgn/urm/myp/etc/env
	/release-mgn/urm/myp/master
3. download latest release, untar release archive to temporary directory, which will be populated by:
- upgrade.sh script
- master directory
4. cd to temporary directory and execute initial install using
	./upgrade.sh /release-mgn/urm/myp
5. copy master/samples/etc/config.sh to /release-mgn/urm/myp/etc
- change product identification properties in config.sh 
6. add Your Product URM to svn (recommended)
	svn import /release-mgn/urm/myp <my-svn-store-path>
