----

= Complex Release Operations =

  * master/release.sh script allows to build, get configuration and DB changes and deploy all into uat environment using one command
{{{
./release.sh default uat - next planned release
./release.sh 1.13.5-demo uat - given release

./release.sh -env express default uat - next planned release but to express environment
}}}

= Update Environment Wrappers =

  * environment wrappers help to set context of deployment operations to avoid risk of harm something in undesired environment
  * if list of environments or their datacenters are changed, set of wrappers should be rebuilt
{{{
make sure etc is up to date:
~/svnget $MYPRODUCT_DEPLOYMENT_HOME/etc

recreate wrappers according to set of environments and datacenters in etc:
./configure.sh

update Your Product URM in svn:
./svnsave.sh
}}}

= Using predefined release labels = 

  * URM supports using predefined release labels in any URM script instead of specific release label
  * predefined release label "last" - points to $C_CONFIG_VERSION_LAST_FULL value defined in product config.sh script
  * predefined release label "next" - points to $C_CONFIG_VERSION_NEXT_FULL value defined in product config.sh script 
  * predefined release label "prod" means release marked with postfix "-prod" in distributive directory
