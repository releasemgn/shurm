#summary Functional Capabilities of URM - Codebase Operations
[home] -> [documentation] -> [features] -> [featurescodeops]

Explains how to maintain product codebase using URM.

<wiki:toc max_depth="2" />
----

= Bulk codebase operations =

  * all operations executed on product codebase can be single-project or it can affect several or all product projects at once
{{{
e.g. single project operation:
./codebase-copytags.sh tag1 tag2 core myproject

do the same with several projects:
./codebase-copytags.sh tag1 tag2 core myproject1 myproject2

do the same with all product projects of specific category (the only usable category here is core):
./codebase-copytags.sh tag1 tag2 core

do the same with all projects of given product:
./codebase-copytags.sh tag1 tag2

do the same with all projects of specific release:
./codebase-copytags.sh -release 1.2.3 prod-1.2.3-candidate prod-1.2.3
this will apply command to all projects included in release.xml located in 1.2.3 distributive folder
}}}

= Tags and branches management =

  * URM allows to perform typical branch and tag operations using unified commands and project names disregarding referencing exact type of vcs and location
  * tag and branch operations are performed disregarding of its build mode - from master/makedistr directory
  * tag and branch operations are dealing with projects, tags and branches, conformed to URM requirements:
{{{
git tag should have name - tag-<anyid>
git branch should have name - branch-<anyid>

svn tag should be in location $PROJECTPATH/$PROJECTNAME/tags/<anyid>
svn branch should be in location $PROJECTPATH/$PROJECTNAME/branches/<anyid>
if branch is "trunk", then path is $PROJECTPATH/$PROJECTNAME/trunk
}}}
  * following tag and branch operations are available:
{{{
copy branch1 (should exist) to branch2 (will be dropped if exists - CAUTION!)
./codebase-copybranch.sh branch1 branch2 ...

copy tag1 (should exist) to tag2 (cancel operation if exists)
./codebase-copynewtags.sh tag1 tag2 ...

copy tag1 (should exist) to tag2 (will be dropped if exists - CAUTION!)
./codebase-copytags.sh tag1 tag2 ...

create branch mybranch (previous will be dropped - CAUTION!) from mytag (should exist)
./codebase-copytagtobranch.sh mytag mybranch ...

drop candidate tags having name "version-candidate":
./codebase-dropoldcandidatetags.sh version ...

drop any tags:
./codebase-tags.sh mytag ...

rename branch1 branch (should exist) to branch2 branch (previous will be dropped - CAUTION!):
./codebase-renamebranch.sh branch1 branch2 ...

rename tag1 tag (should exist) to tag tag (previous will be dropped - CAUTION!):
./codebase-renametags.sh tag1 tag2 ...
}}}

= Bulk codebase updates =

  * URM simplifies operations with products having multiple codebase projects
  * to export all the product codebase

= Custom operations =
= Find changeset tickets =
