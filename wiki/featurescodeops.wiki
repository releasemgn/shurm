----

= Tags and branches management =

  * URM allows to perform typical branch and tag operations using unified commands and project names disregarding referencing exact type of vcs and location
  * tag and branch operations are performed disregarding of its build mode - from master/makedistr directory
  * branch operation can be single-project or it can affect several or all product projects at once
{{{
e.g. single project operation:
./codebase-copytags.sh tag1 tag2 core myproject

do the same with several projects:
./codebase-copytags.sh tag1 tag2 core myproject1 myproject2

do the same with all product projects of specific category (the only usable category here is core):
./codebase-copytags.sh tag1 tag2 core

do the same with all projects of given product:
./codebase-copytags.sh tag1 tag2

do the same with all projects of specific release:
./codebase-copytags.sh -release 1.2.3 prod-1.2.3-candidate prod-1.2.3
this will apply command to all projects included in release.xml located in 1.2.3 distributive folder
