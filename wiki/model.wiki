= Definitions =

  * *URM model* - set of files, xml element types and attributes to specify product codebase, distributive and environments for automated processing in build, distributive preparation and deployment
  * *URM specification* - xml file, part of URM model

= Overview =

  * declarative specifications define product to a level of detail, sufficient to perform generic release engineering activities
  * URM model allows to limit product knowledge, required from operation teams, ensures product operating flexibility, which gives developer a means to deliver changes to production without risk and without explaining all the details to operation team
  * URM model allows to manage huge distributed system in a consistent manner with common terms and release approaches
  * URM model is quite compact and helps to engineer, review and re-engineer your IT system
  * as well as URM model is used for automated deployment and environment control, it can be used as reliable source of information regarding physical elements of the system
