= Release planning and updates =

  * release planning is performed using release specification file release.xml located in ditributive folder
  * release.xml defines components included in release
{{{
example of release definition aimed to build and deploy all binaries and configuration:
<release>
	<build>
		<buildset type="core" all="true"/>
		<buildset type="prebuilt" all="true"/>
	</build>

	<configure all="true"/>
</release>

more specific incremental release can limit projects and components included:
<release>
	<build>
		<buildset type="core">
			<project name="pgu-paygate"/>
			<project name="pgu-portal"/>
			<project name="pgu-forms-core-front"/>
			<project name="pgu-forms-svc"/>
			<project name="sp"/>
			<project name="pgu-forms-core-back"/>
			<project name="bem"/>
			<project name="pgu-core">
				<distitem name="smev-lk-service"/>
				<distitem name="drafts"/>
				<distitem name="pgu-worker"/>
			</project>
		</buildset>

		<buildset type="prebuilt">
                        <project name="carcass" buildversion="3.12">
         	                <distitem name="frgu-integration-inc"/>
         	                <distitem name="frgu-integration-groovy"/>
                        </project>
		</buildset>
	</build>

        <configure>
                <component partial="true" name="serviceregistry.settings.conf"/>
                <component partial="true" name="jms.conf"/>
        </configure>
</release>

Last example means:
- building project pgu-portal and deploying all its registered binaries
- building project pgu-core and deploying only listed 3 binaries
- downloading 2 listed prebuild dependency binaries

Configure:
- download and deploy 2 configuration components - only present in release repository
