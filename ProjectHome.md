**URM - Unified Release Management**

URM allows you to split your IT system into products and manage it with full or incremental releases spending optimal time for operations, equally from dev teams and release administration team. Adding your specific QA process on top of URM framework, you will be able to provide more or less control over workflow steps.

See:
  * [Quick Start](setup.md)
  * [Documentation](documentation.md)
  * [Releases](releases.md)

**Pimary features supported:**
  * system configuration tracking, product codebase accounting
  * flexible and agile release planning practices
  * release builds and distribution maintenance, tagging and branching
  * environment management and deployment, changing binaries, configuration files and performing database updates, express-monitoring and health-checking
  * all the above - fast, integrated and proved to handle large clustered configurations with hundreds of servers using the only or multiple administration boxes

Though URM can be used for different purposes, it is primarily intended to handle distributed server-based enterprise applications, not desktop ones.

**Technology stack:**
  * bash/Linux
  * Oracle
  * xml/xmlstartet
  * svn/git
  * Maven/Nexus
  * JIRA/Confluence
  * Skype/Jabber

**Common factors notes**:
  * depth of visibility: framework to see both business-level and technical changes, trace any release item to source code and change ticket
  * level of automation: build and deployment are automatic and derived from release planning
  * release flexibility: full, incremental, emergency releases with various binary, configuration and database updates without risk
  * ability to recover: cross-project tags, rollback deployment, configuration coverage features allow to recover from erroneous development, deployment or environment maintenance
  * release speed: command-center model with parallel-mode and offline support allow to perform operations as fast as possible
  * release reliability: each workflow step has facilities to cope with error conditions, without loss of control
  * release quality: baseline release lifecycle supports smooth transfer from one release phase to another with guaranteed level of control over product quality

**Using URM**

URM is now like product off-the-shelf - ready to use and stable.
Still it is subject for improvements, that can be done by request.
I would be happy to share this stuff, so please let me know if you have questions or need new features to start/extend using of URM.
